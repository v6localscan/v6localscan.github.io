v6LocalScan is an application designed to help users monitor the security and privacy of their local IPv6 network. One potential threat to security and privacy in IPv6 networks is the use of EUI-64 addresses, which are legacy addresses. EUI-64 addresses can be a privacy concern because they contain a unique identifier that is derived from the device's MAC address. This identifier can be used to track the device and expose its location, potentially compromising the privacy of the user.

v6LocalScan scans the local network for devices that use EUI-64 addresses and provides users with a clear understanding of which devices may pose a privacy risk. By keeping a record of the IPv6 prefixes assigned to a user, v6LocalScan also helps to identify a network provider's prefix rotation policy. This allows users to take action to improve the security and privacy of their network.
