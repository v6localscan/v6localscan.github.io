IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol that is used for transmitting data over the internet. Unlike its predecessor, IPv4, IPv6 has a larger address space, which enables it to accommodate a vast number of devices connected to the internet. However, one of the issues with IPv6 is its use of EUI-64 addresses, which can pose a privacy risk. EUI-64 addresses are generated by combining the device's MAC address and a prefix, which makes it possible to track a device's location and activity on the internet. This information can be used for malicious purposes, such as targeted advertising and cyber attacks. To mitigate these privacy issues, it's recommended to use privacy extensions in IPv6, which can randomize the EUI-64 address and keep the device's activity private. v6LocalScan allows you to view devices on your network that are using legacy EUI-64 addresses.
